### #1
The user can access from anywhere in the world, and consequently with a timezone different from our server,
we must ensure that he has minimum 'x' years.

***example:***

The Server is in Italy (UTC +1)

My birthdate is August 13, 1987.

I access the site from Texas (UTC -6) August 12 at 19:00 pm -> is not my birthday yet, i have not the required age

I access the site from Texas (UTC -6) on 13 August at 00.01 am -> It's my birthday, I have the required age

What do I need?

* The timezone of the user as well as the date of his birthday.
* Today's date in UTC.
